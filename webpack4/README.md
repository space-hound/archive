# webpack4

Just some simple **webpack** configurations that I use, or tested. Both for single page apps or multiple pages. All configurations includes a `package.json` file with some standard webpack apps dependencies (dev).

<hr>

### [webpack-single](https://github.com/space-hound/webpack4/tree/webpack-single)

 - Simple configuration for a single page app.

```sh
git clone -b webpack-single --single-branch git@github.com:space-hound/webpack4.git
cd webpack4/
rm -rf .git
```

<hr>

### [webpack-multiple](https://github.com/space-hound/webpack4/tree/webpack-multiple)

 - Simple configuration for a multiple page app.

```sh
git clone -b webpack-multiple --single-branch git@github.com:space-hound/webpack4.git
cd webpack4/
rm -rf .git
```

<hr>

### [webpack-custom](https://github.com/space-hound/webpack4/tree/webpack-custom)

 - Simple custom configuration for a multiple page app.

```sh
git clone -b webpack-custom --single-branch git@github.com:space-hound/webpack4.git
cd webpack4/
rm -rf .git
```

<hr>

### [webpack-p5](https://github.com/space-hound/webpack4/tree/webpack-p5)

 - Simple configuration for a p5.js app.

```sh
git clone -b webpack-p5 --single-branch git@github.com:space-hound/webpack4.git
cd webpack4/
rm -rf .git
```

<hr>

### [webpack-vue](https://github.com/space-hound/webpack4/tree/webpack-vue) (nothing here yet)

 - Simple configuration for a vue app.

```sh
git clone -b webpack-vue --single-branch git@github.com:space-hound/webpack4.git
cd webpack4/
rm -rf .git
```

<hr>

### [webpack-test](https://github.com/space-hound/webpack4/tree/webpack-test)

 - I just played with the configuration and split it into multiple files, works for single page and multi page app, but is quite confusing, even to me, who I wrote the code.

```sh
git clone -b webpack-test --single-branch git@github.com:space-hound/webpack4.git
cd webpack4/
rm -rf .git
```
