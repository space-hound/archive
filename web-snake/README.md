 - A simple snake game that I made after watching [this coding challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM),  basically is the same game, but with some things implemented differently, and has a UI, that honestly I did only for that form from the beginning as I really wanted to implement that button with the gradient on hover and those radio buttons.
 - Is reactive in the sense that changes in the game are reflected in the score board, like the score has changed, or new food is spawned, or the button that is active depending on the state of the game.
 - The only dependency of the game is the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/), which is quite a cool "engine", for quick and learning stuff without too much set-up.
 - I used ES6 features like [classes](http://es6-features.org/#ClassDefinition), [spread operator](http://es6-features.org/#SpreadOperator), [template literals](http://es6-features.org/#StringInterpolation), etc.
 - Also I made use of the [reactor pattern](https://gist.github.com/mohsen1/5123533) and a simplistic [store pattern](https://css-tricks.com/build-a-state-management-system-with-vanilla-javascript/).
