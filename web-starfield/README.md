[Live Demo Here!](https://space-hound.github.io/web-starfield/)

A starfield made in `JavaScript` made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM), but I made it in my way, and was meant to be an animated background cover for an app, but that was dropped.
 
 - Move mouse in the Y axis to change the speed of the stars.
